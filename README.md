# Hey! My name is Ben Timor! :)
// I'm a full stack software developer from Israel ![Israel Flag](https://i.imgur.com/5WoWl1s.png). 

- Usually, I develop in JavaScript and TypeScript. And I know what you all think - JavaScript is the worst language in the world. So let me tell you that Hebrew is even worse, And if I could do it when I was 3 years old I can do JavaScript now.

 `console.log("Hey, Whassup?");`

- Obviously, For backend I use NodeJS. For frontend I usually use React this days. But Svelte is fucking better and I wish I could use it more (But sadly, My manager doesn't feel the same).

`<Message> Hey! :) </Message>`

- Python was my first language and I really like it. It's simple, intuitive and fun to code. Almost everytime someone asks me "What language should I learn?", I tell them English. And if they already know English, I tell them to learn Python.

`print("It's so amazing I can just write 'print' and use it!")`

- Additionally, I think that Rust is an amazing language and I really hope that companies would adopt it. but I'm not so much of a low-level developer. 

`!println("I think I'm in love with macros.");`

/* Sure, Programming languages are nice. But I'm also a GNU/Linux user (Arch!) and it makes me a pro developer for sure. Trust me. */

 ## A little about some of my projects
 ### [Straw (Python)](https://github.com/BenTimor/Straw) / [IronStraw (Rust)](https://github.com/BenTimor/IronStraw) <img src=https://static.thenounproject.com/png/563031-200.png alt=straw height=20>
 Straw project has only two purposes. 

1. I looked for a project that is both **easy enough** to develop in a programming language which you're new to and **advanced enough** so you'll be able to learn something in the process. <br />
Straw is a HTML template engine which allows you to dynamically create HTML pages via Straw language. Straw's code is very similar to modern programming languages, but simpler and sometimes relies on other languages features. 
2. I actually really needed a template engine for my Flask proejcts. HTML is fucking annoying.

### [Trading212API (Python)](https://github.com/BenTimor/Trading212API) <img src=https://cdn1.iconfinder.com/data/icons/infographic-vol-7/512/10-512.png alt=graph height=20>

[Trading212](https://www.trading212.com) is an amazing broker. But you know, the first thing that every developer needs when he's looking for a broker is an API. 

Because Trading212 doesn't have any official API, I've just developed a selenium based - unofficial one.

### [Qeres (TypeScript)](https://github.com/BenTimor/Qeres) <img src=https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/minecraft/images/f/f3/LapisLazuliBlock.png alt=lapis height=20>

Qeres is pretty simple. I've tried to create a simple way to create APIs, But I wanted something a little bit more advanced than REST.

That's where Qeres comes. It's simple, flexible and powerful.

And I have several more projects. Just look at my [repositories](https://github.com/BenTimor?tab=repositories).
