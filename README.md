# Hey! My name is Ben Timor! :)
// I'm a software developer from Israel ![Israel Flag](https://i.imgur.com/5WoWl1s.png). 

- I mainly develop in Python programming language <img src=https://icons.iconarchive.com/icons/martin-berube/animal/256/snake-icon.png alt=snake height=20> which is no doubt an amazing language!
- Additionally, I really like developing in Rust language <img src=https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1*lmv2kXnZ9qsUGkrPz__QsQ.png alt=rust_icon height=20> which is a pure beautiful language.
- And sometimes even in Java <img src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/aa/95/01/aa9501df489c885cce3f31b0fc6234ef.png alt=coffee height=20>, but it's only because of IntelliJ, the best IDE which has ever been created.

// Yeah programming languages is nice, But I'm also a GNU/Linux (Arch) <img src=https://i.imgur.com/2jwDqeH.png alt=pengiun height=20> user and it makes me a pro developer, trust me.

### Just let me say hello <img alt=hello src=https://www.flaticon.com/svg/static/icons/svg/2165/2165693.svg height=20>
For Python native speakers:

    print("Hello! And welcome to my GitHub page! :)")

And for Rust new speakers:

    println!("Just look at the beauty of this macro @.@");

And of course we're not going to forget Java:

    System.out.println("Couldn't they just call it 'Syso'??!");

 ## A little about some of my projects
 ### [Straw (Python)](https://github.com/BenTimor/Straw) / [IronStraw (Rust)](https://github.com/BenTimor/IronStraw) <img src=https://static.thenounproject.com/png/563031-200.png alt=straw height=20>
 Straw project has only two purposes. 

1. I looked for a project that is both **easy enough** to develop in a programming language which you're new to and **advanced enough** so you'll be able to learn something in the process. <br />
Straw is a HTML template engine which allows you to dynamically create HTML pages via Straw language. Straw's code is very similar to modern programming languages, but simpler and sometimes relies on other languages features. 
2. I actually really needed a template engine for my Flask proejcts. HTML is fucking annoying.

### [Trading212API (Python)](https://github.com/BenTimor/Trading212API) <img src=https://cdn1.iconfinder.com/data/icons/infographic-vol-7/512/10-512.png alt=graph height=20>

[Trading212](https://www.trading212.com) is an amazing broker. But you know, the first thing that every developer needs when he's looking for a broker is an API. 

Because Trading212 doesn't have any official API, I've just developed a selenium based - unofficial one.

### [BlueStoneUtils (Java)](https://github.com/BenTimor/BlueStoneUtils) <img src=https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/minecraft/images/f/f3/LapisLazuliBlock.png alt=lapis height=20>
It's a pretty old project and I haven't developed it in a long time, But I'm still proud of it.

BlueStoneUtils is just a bunch of utils which I've been working on. It has several features, But I really like two of them.
1. [ReflectionUtils](https://github.com/BenTimor/BlueStoneUtils/blob/master/blue/bluestone/utils/reflection/ReflectionUtils.java) - Allows you to use reflection almost like it's not a reflection. You can pretty much write path.class.object.method and use it like it was a normal method/object.
2. [Serialization](https://github.com/BenTimor/BlueStoneUtils/blob/master/blue/bluestone/utils/Serialization.java) - Making Java serialization as easy as it was [pickle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html) <img src=https://image.flaticon.com/icons/png/512/605/605132.png alt=pickle height=20> in Python.

And I have several more projects. Just look at my [repositories](https://github.com/BenTimor?tab=repositories).
