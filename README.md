# Hey! I'm Ben Timor! :)

// I'm a full-stack developer from Israel ![Israel Flag](https://i.imgur.com/5WoWl1s.png).

If you're interested in my resume, you can check it out on my [website](https://bentimor.com) or find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bentimor).

- I mostly work with JavaScript and TypeScript. And I know what you're thinking – JavaScript is the worst language ever. But hey, Hebrew is worse, and if I could master it by the age of 3, JavaScript is a piece of cake now.

```js
console.log("Hey, Whassup?");
```

- On the backend, I'm a NodeJS guy. For the frontend, it's usually React these days, though I'm also a big fan of Svelte.

```jsx
<Message> Hey! :) </Message>
```

- Python was my first love in programming. It's straightforward, intuitive, and just plain fun. If someone asks me, "What language should I learn?", I tell them English first. If they already know English, then Python's the answer.

```py
print("It's so amazing I can just write 'print' and use it!")
```

- I'm also into Rust. It's a fantastic language, and I hope more companies start adopting it. Though, I'm not that deep into low-level stuff.

```rust
!println("I think I'm in love with macros.");
```

/* Sure, coding languages are awesome, but I'm also a proud GNU/Linux user (Arch ftw!), which automatically makes me a pro. Trust me. */

## A bit about my projects

### [Straw (Python)](https://github.com/BenTimor/Straw) / [IronStraw (Rust)](https://github.com/BenTimor/IronStraw) <img src=https://static.thenounproject.com/png/563031-200.png alt=straw height=20>

Straw has only two goals.

1. I wanted a project that was **easy enough** to get into a new programming language, but **advanced enough** to actually learn something. <br />

Straw is an HTML template engine that lets you create HTML pages dynamically. The Straw language is very similar to modern programming ones but simpler and sometimes borrows features from others.

2. I needed a template engine for my Flask projects. Plain HTML can be a real headache.

### [Trading212API (Python)](https://github.com/BenTimor/Trading212API) <img src=https://cdn1.iconfinder.com/data/icons/infographic-vol-7/512/10-512.png alt=graph height=20>

[Trading212](https://www.trading212.com) is an awesome broker. But the first thing any dev wants from a broker is an API.

Since Trading212 doesn’t have an official API, I created an unofficial one based on Selenium.

### [Qeres (TypeScript)](https://github.com/BenTimor/Qeres) <img src=https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/minecraft/images/f/f3/LapisLazuliBlock.png alt=lapis height=20>

Qeres is a new way to create web APIs, designed to be flexible, beginner-friendly, and fast.
